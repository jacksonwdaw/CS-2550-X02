    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Reading has always been a personal hobby/addiction for as long as I can remember. 
        Everyone in my family was avid readers so it was only a matter of time for me to take interest in books. 
        My favorite genres have always been High Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Fantasy, and yes there is a difference between the two.
        At some point in my reading journey I realised I had acquired well over 200 novels and didn't see any signs of stopping, I don't regret it I just wish I had more space for books.
        I also enjoy reading comics, be it American comics, Korean Manwha, Japanese Manga, or Chinese Manhwa, I adore all types of comics and also own large amounts of comics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another Interest of mine is twofold Dungeons and Dragons and also Magic the Gathering, one is a TTRPG (Table Top Role Playing Game) and the other a deck-building card game.
        I've played D&D for well over a decade at this point and have enjoyed every minute of it, I've played numerous rule systems like 5e, Pathfinder, Edge of the Empire and more.
        My MTG problem started in 2020 while on my mission as I needed something to act as a placeholder for my other hobbies.
        once I started playing MTG there was no going back, it was simply too much fun to build a deck, play with it, then lose with it, then tweak it, and repeat the process ad infinitum.
        Now that I'm off my mission and in college I've had to slow down both hobbies quite a bit lest I go bankrupt, but I still am an avid enjoyer of both.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last big hobby I have is playing video games, besides reading video games is my oldest hobby and most prolific one. 
        I started off with the Halo series as all gamers should, and moved to so many games like the Assassin's Creed series, the Borderlands series, and more throughout the years.
        Eventually I moved away from being a console user to being a PC user full time, since I made the switch I've never looked back and never wanted to.
        Nowadays I play a wide variety of games but I enjoy automation games like Factorio, Action games like the Souls series, Roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate 3, and long play games like Genshin Impact or Warframe.
        it was this hobby that got me into programming, as I really enjoyed being on my computer and learning more and more about how it and the games I played were constructed.
